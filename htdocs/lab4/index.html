							 However, according to a new study, the emotions associated with events can persist long after the events themselves have been forgotten: Feelings Without Memory in Alzheimer Disease


							In their paper, the researchers, University of Iowa neurologists Edmarie Guzman-Velez and colleagues, showed volunteers a series of emotional video clips, chosen to be either very sad or very happy.

							The eight sad clips, for example, included an excerpt from the movie Sophie’s Choice (1982) in which ‘a woman is forced to choose which of her children to keep at a Nazi concentration camp’. The happy videos, by contrast, featured such classics as ‘a collage of funny scenes with babies’ from America’s Funniest Home Videos.
							Half of the participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, while half were healthy controls, matched for age and gender. Memory tests showed that the Alzheimer’s patients could recall few details of the sad film clips, even just minutes after watching them. Four of the patients couldn’t recall any facts about the movies, and one didn’t remember watching any video clips at all.
							The patients with Alzheimer’s reported feeling elevated levels of sadness that lasted for up to 30 minutes after the films, despite having little or no recollection of the content… Across all participants, the correlation between memory performance and sadness during the final rating was significant, but in a negative direction (r = 0.37, n = 34). This paradoxical effect actually suggests that the less the patients remembered about the films, the longer their sadness lasted.

							Despite their severe memory impairment, all 4 patients who could not recollect any details about the films reported sustained feelings of sadness after the memory test, and 3 reported feeling sad even 30 minutes later

							We put a lot of faith in memory, perhaps too much. When someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it’s almost easier to treat them as a lost cause – they’ve forfeited all claims to be rational, to be fully human, and so we get to ignore their distracted pleas and increasingly absurd demands.

							Our compassion recedes as their dementia advances. Memory, we believe, gives life its structure. When it fails, that’s the end of autonomy, no matter how much eating and sleeping and breathing remain. This makes sense, at least to those of us who have to pick up the pieces: When someone can’t remember what you told them yesterday, why should they get to dictate what will happen tomorrow? If that sounds cold, just wait until you get there.

							My stepfather kept demanding the keys to the car in which he’d been apprehended while driving the wrong way along the highway on a cross-province mission to pick up his daughter came back, against her doctors’ best guesses. She couldn’t speak. She was partly paralyzed. And yet she ran my stepfather’s life as he descended toward dementia.

							“Earlier in life, I saw him as a charming man,” he says, “but very powerful and very authoritative and that intimidated me.” When he decided to drop out of Oxford, his father couldn’t help but criticize. Later, Jonathan got caught up in the U.S. civil-rights movement, abandoned plans of going to graduate school and decided instead to become an inner-city teacher and advocate. Again, his father told him it was too risky, even though in his professional life he always sided with young patients who wanted to flee the respectability their worried parents had designed for them.
